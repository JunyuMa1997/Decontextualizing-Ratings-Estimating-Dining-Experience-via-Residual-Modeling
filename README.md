# Decontextualizing-Ratings-Estimating-Dining-Experience-via-Residual-Modeling
Restaurant ratings are shaped by more than food and servics. Non-experiential factors like location, accessibility, price, and popularity can confound what the score actually reflects. Nonetheless, some diners would like to separate these factors when evaluating a restaurant. This project isolates the "true dining experience" by modeling expected ratings based on contextual attributes and treating the residuals as a proxy for intrinsic quality.
